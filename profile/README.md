**Research-driven tools for AI evaluation and alignment diagnostics**

## 🧪 Active Projects

### [AI Agency Evals](https://github.com/Course-Correct-Labs/ai-agency-evals)
Reproducible evaluation suite implementing diagnostic tests from three LLM behavior research papers:

- **Phi Eval** — Epistemic pathology detection (overconfidence metrics)
- **DI Eval** — Delegated introspection measurement (reflective thought migration)
- **OT Bench** — Observer-time diagnostics (temporal consciousness tests)

All experiments run in < 2 minutes with mock mode for reproducibility.

## 📚 Research Foundations

Our evaluation frameworks operationalize theoretical work in:

- **Epistemic virtue theory** (Zagzebski, Roberts & Wood)
- **Speech-act theory** (Austin, Searle)
- **Phenomenology of time** (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre)
- **RLHF alignment research** (Christiano et al.)

All manuscripts are currently under peer review. Repositories contain implementation code and evaluation frameworks only.

## 🎯 Mission

To develop **faithful, minimal-compute experiments** that:

1. Operationalize theoretical claims about LLM behavior
2. Enable reproducible diagnostics without proprietary data
3. Distinguish registration from constitution in machine cognition
4. Map epistemic pathologies to measurable metrics

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome:
- Additional model implementations (local, open-source)
- Extended question sets and evaluation scenarios
- Real user studies to complement simulated dialogues
- Multi-language support

All contributions must maintain theoretical fidelity to source papers.
